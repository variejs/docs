## Components

Components are auto loaded with kebab casing into the application as long as your using the `autoLoadComponents` provider in your config. Only components in the main directory are auto loaded, to allow you to create sub components of your components without auto loading them in.

### Examples :

    .
     +-- app
        +-- components
            +-- Notifications.vue

Will auto load the component `<notifications><notifications>`.

    .
     +-- app
        +-- components
            +-- Notifications.vue
            +-- notification_components
                +-- NotificationItem.vue

Will not auto load `<notification-item></notification-item>`
