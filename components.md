# Components

* [Creating a component](#creating-a-component)

Components are auto loaded with kebab casing into the application as long as your using the `autoLoadComponents` provider in your config.
Only components in the main directory are auto loaded, to allow you to create sub components of your components without auto loading them in.

     +-- app
        +-- components
            +-- LeftNav.vue
            +-- Notifications.vue
            +-- notification_components
                +-- NotificationItem.vue
